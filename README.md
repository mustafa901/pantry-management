# pantry-management
To build a pantry management application with the requirements you mentioned, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Set Up Next.js with Material UI
a. Create a New Next.js Project
b. Install Material UI

c. Set Up Material UI Theme:
-  In `pages/_app.js`, wrap your application with the Material UI theme provider
-  Create a `src/theme.js` to define your Material UI theme


2. Set Up Firebase Backend

a. Install Firebase SDK
b. Initialize Firebase
c. Create Firestore Service for CRUD Operations:
-  Create a `services/pantryService.js` file

3. Create a Form to Add, Delete, and Update Pantry Items

a. Create a Form Component
-  Create a `components/PantryForm.js` file
b. Implement the List Component with Actions
-  Create a `components/PantryList.js` file:


4. Add Search or Filter Functionality
a. Create a Search Component:
-  Create a `components/SearchBar.js` file:
b. Implement Search Functionality in the Home Page:


5. Presentable Frontend Design
a. Use Material UI Components for Better UI/UX:
-  Consider using `Grid`, `Card`, and other Material UI components to improve the look and feel.

6. Deploy to Vercel and Implement CI/CD
a.  Deploy to Vercel:
   - Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
   - Import your GitHub repository (where your project is stored).
   - Deploy your Next.js app directly from Vercel.

b. Set Up CI/CD:
   - Vercel automatically sets up CI/CD when you deploy from GitHub.
   - Each time you push changes to the `main` branch (or another branch you configure), Vercel will redeploy your application.

c. Environment Variables:
   - Add your Firebase configuration keys as environment variables in Vercel under the "Settings" tab for your project.

 7. Final Testing
   - Once deployed, ensure that all CRUD operations work correctly.
   - Test the search/filter functionality.
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
   - Verify that the CI/CD pipeline works as expected.

This setup will help you build a fully functional pantry management application with Next.js, Material UI, Firebase backend, search functionality, and deployment with CI/CD on Vercel.
